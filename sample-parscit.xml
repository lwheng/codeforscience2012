The IEEE 802.11e standard specifies a new medium access coordination function called Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) which is only usable in QoS network configurations. The contention-based channel access method of HCF function is called Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA).</context>

In [9,10] , authors analyzed IEEE 802.11e under non-saturation condition. However, their models have inaccuracies related to backoff countdown and ignore TXOP. In [11] , the authors proposed a three dimensional Markov chain that for the first time includes TXOP limit. However, the model does not include AIFS countdown. In [12] , Abu-Sharkh and Tewfik proposed a complex multi-dimensional Markov chain which covers important features of IEEE 802.11e EDCA under finite load. Though their model covers important features of IEEE 802.11e EDCA, it includes some inaccuracies. The main inaccuracy is related to the AIFS sensing period.

In the simulation we consider four ACs. For focusing on the differentiation parameters and achieving clearer results we consider that each station has exactly one queue with a specific AC. We assume a single hop ad-hoc network with n k nodes transmitting frames from traffic class k for which the frame destination is chosen randomly. We suppose five stations from every access category unless otherwise mentioned. The transmission rate is set to 2 Mbps. According to the standard the header fields are transmitted at 1 Mbps. Frame size excluding the MAC and PHY headers is set to 100 B, except the case that we investigate the effects of frame size on the network performance in which we consider frames of 500 B payload size too. In the simulation we employ RTS/CTS mechanism for transmission of all frames by all the stations. Therefore, collision can occur only for RTS frames. The buffer size of every station is set to 32 KB. Therefore, the buffer overflow occurs in saturation condition for all the stations and the extra frames are dropped.</context>
