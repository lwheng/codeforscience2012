1. Introduction 
There is a growing consensus that significant, rapid progress can be made in both text 
understanding and spoken language understanding by investigating those phenom- 
ena that occur most centrally in naturally occurring unconstrained materials and by 
attempting to automatically extract information about language from very large cor- 
pora. Such corpora are beginning to serve as important research tools for investigators 
in natural language processing, speech recognition, and integrated spoken language 
systems, as well as in theoretical linguistics. Annotated corpora promise to be valu- 
able for enterprises as diverse as the automatic construction of statistical models for 
the grammar of the written and the colloquial spoken language, the development of 
explicit formal theories of the differing grammars of writing and speech, the investi- 
gation of prosodic phenomena in speech, and the evaluation and comparison of the 
adequacy of parsing models. 
In this paper, we review our experience with constructing one such large annotated 
corpus--the Penn Treebank, a corpus 1 consisting of over 4.5 million words of American 
English. During the first three-year phase of the Penn Treebank Project (1989-1992), this 
corpus has been annotated for part-of-speech (POS) information. In addition, over half 
of it has been annotated for skeletal syntactic structure. These materials are available 
to members of the Linguistic Data Consortium; for details, see Section 5.1. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the POS tagging task. After 
outlining the considerations that informed the design of our POS tagset and pre- 
senting the tagset itself, we describe our two-stage tagging process, in which text 
is first assigned POS tags automatically and then corrected by human annotators. 
Section 3 briefly presents the results of a comparison between entirely manual and 
semi-automated tagging, with the latter being shown to be superior on three counts: 
speed, consistency, and accuracy. In Section 4, we turn to the bracketing task. Just as 
with the tagging task, we have partially automated the bracketing task: the output of

1 A distinction is sometimes made between a corpus as a carefully structured set of materials gathered 
together to jointly meet some design principles, and a collection, which may be much more 
opportunistic in construction. We acknowledge that from this point of view, the raw materials of the 
Penn Treebank form a collection.

the POS tagging phase is automatically parsed and simplified to yield a skeletal syn- 
tactic representation, which is then corrected by human annotators. After presenting 
the set of syntactic tags that we use, we illustrate and discuss the bracketing process. In 
particular, we will outline various factors that affect the speed with which annotators 
are able to correct bracketed structures, a task that--not surprisingly--is considerably 
more difficult than correcting POS-tagged text. Finally, Section 5 describes the com- 
position and size of the current Treebank corpus, briefly reviews some of the research 
projects that have relied on it to date, and indicates the directions that the project is 
likely to take in the future. 
2. Part-of-Speech Tagging 
2.1 A Simplified POS Tagset for English 
The POS tagsets used to annotate large corpora in the past have traditionally been 
fairly extensive. The pioneering Brown Corpus distinguishes 87 simple tags (Francis 
1964; Francis and Ku~era 1982) and allows the formation of compound tags; thus, the 
contraction I'm is tagged as PPSS+BEM (PPSS for "non-third person nominative per- 
sonal pronoun" and BEM for "am, 'm". 2 Subsequent projects have tended to elaborate 
the Brown Corpus tagset. For instance, the Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen (LOB) Corpus uses 
about 135 tags, the Lancaster UCREL group about 165 tags, and the London-Lund Cor- 
pus of Spoken English 197 tags. 3 The rationale behind developing such large, richly 
articulated tagsets is to approach "the ideal of providing distinct codings for all classes 
of words having distinct grammatical behaviour" (Garside, Leech, and Sampson 1987, 
p. 167). 
2.1.1 Recoverability. Like the tagsets just mentioned, the Penn Treebank tagset is based 
on that of the Brown Corpus. However, the stochastic orientation of the Penn Tree- 
bank and the resulting concern with sparse data led us to modify the Brown Corpus 
tagset by paring it down considerably. A key strategy in reducing the tagset was to 
eliminate redundancy by taking into account both lexical and syntactic information. 
Thus, whereas many POS tags in the Brown Corpus tagset are unique to a particular 
lexical item, the Penn Treebank tagset strives to eliminate such instances of lexical re- 
dundancy. For instance, the Brown Corpus distinguishes five different forms for main 
verbs: the base form is tagged VB, and forms with overt endings are indicated by 
appending D for past tense, G for present participle/gerund, N for past participle, 
and Z for third person singular present. Exactly the same paradigm is recognized for 
have, but have (regardless of whether it is used as an auxiliary or a main verb) is as- 
signed its own base tag HV. The Brown Corpus further distinguishes three forms of 
do--the base form (DO), the past tense (DOD), and the third person singular present 
(DOZ), 4 and eight forms of be--the five forms distinguished for regular verbs as well 
as the irregular forms am (BEM), are (BER), and was (BEDZ). By contrast, since the 
distinctions between the forms of VB on the one hand and the forms of BE, DO, and 
HV on the other are lexically recoverable, they are eliminated in the Penn Treebank, 
as shown in Table 1. 5 
2 Counting both simple and compound tags, the Brown Corpus tagset contains 187 tags. 
3 A useful overview of the relation of these and other tagsets to each other and to the Brown Corpus 
tagset is given in Appendix B of Garside, Leech, and Sampson (1987). 
4 The gerund and the participle of do are tagged VBG and VBN in the Brown Corpus, 
respectively--presumably because they are never used as auxiliary verbs in American English. 
5 The irregular present tense forms am and are are tagged as VBP in the Penn Treebank (see 
Section 2.1.3), just like any other non-third person singular present tense form.

sung/VBN been/VBN done/VBN had/VBN 
A second example of lexical recoverability concerns those words that can precede 
articles in noun phrases. The Brown Corpus assigns a separate tag to pre-qualifiers 
(quite, rather, such), pre-quantifiers (all, half, many, nary) and both. The Penn Treebank, 
on the other hand, assigns all of these words to a single category PDT (predeterminer). 
Further examples of lexically recoverable categories are the Brown Corpus categories 
PPL (singular reflexive pronoun) and PPLS (plural reflexive pronoun), which we col- 
lapse with PRP (personal pronoun), and the Brown Corpus category RN (nominal 
adverb), which we collapse with RB (adverb). 
Beyond reducing lexically recoverable distinctions, we also eliminated certain POS 
distinctions that are recoverable with reference to syntactic structure. For instance, the 
Penn Treebank tagset does not distinguish subject pronouns from object pronouns 
even in cases where the distinction is not recoverable from the pronoun's form, as 
with you, since the distinction is recoverable on the basis of the pronoun's position 
in the parse tree in the parsed version of the corpus. Similarly, the Penn Treebank 
tagset conflates subordinating conjunctions with prepositions, tagging both categories 
as IN. The distinction between the two categories is not lost, however, since subor- 
dinating conjunctions can be recovered as those instances of IN that precede clauses, 
whereas prepositions are those instances of IN that precede noun phrases or preposi- 
tional phrases. We would like to emphasize that the lexical and syntactic recoverability 
inherent in the POS-tagged version of the Penn Treebank corpus allows end users to 
employ a much richer tagset than the small one described in Section 2.2 if the need 
arises. 
2.1.2 Consistency. As noted above, one reason for eliminating a POS tag such as RN 
(nominal adverb) is its lexical recoverability. Another important reason for doing so is 
consistency. For instance, in the Brown Corpus, the deictic adverbs there and now are 
always tagged RB (adverb), whereas their counterparts here and then are inconsistently 
tagged as RB (adverb) or RN (nominal adverb) even in identical syntactic contexts, 
such as after a preposition. It is clear that reducing the size of the tagset reduces the 
chances of such tagging inconsistencies. 
2.1.3 Syntactic Function. A further difference between the Penn Treebank and the 
Brown Corpus concerns the significance accorded to syntactic context. In the Brown 
Corpus, words tend to be tagged independently of their syntactic function. 6 For in- 
stance, in the phrase the one, one is always tagged as CD (cardinal number), whereas 
6 An important exception is there, which the Brown Corpus tags as EX (existential there) when it is used as a formal subject and as RB (adverb) when it is used as a locative adverb. In the case of there, we did 
not pursue our strategy of tagset reduction to its logical conclusion, which would have implied tagging existential there as NN (common noun). 
315 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
in the corresponding plural phrase the ones, ones is always tagged as NNS (plural com- 
mon noun), despite the parallel function of one and ones as heads of the noun phrase. 
By contrast, since one of the main roles of the tagged version of the Penn Treebank 
corpus is to serve as the basis for a bracketed version of the corpus, we encode a 
word's syntactic function in its POS tag whenever possible. Thus, one is tagged as NN 
(singular common noun) rather than as CD (cardinal number) when it is the head of 
a noun phrase. Similarly, while the Brown Corpus tags both as ABX (pre-quantifier, 
double conjunction), regardless of whether it functions as a prenominal modifier (both 
the boys), a postnominal modifier (the boys both), the head of a noun phrase (both of 
the boys) or part of a complex coordinating conjunction (both boys and girls), the Penn 
Treebank tags both differently in each of these syntactic contexts--as PDT (predeter- 
miner), RB (adverb), NNS (plural common noun) and coordinating conjunction (CC), 
respectively. 
There is one case in which our concern with tagging by syntactic function has led 
us to bifurcate Brown Corpus categories rather than to collapse them: namely, in the 
case of the uninflected form of verbs. Whereas the Brown Corpus tags the bare form 
of a verb as VB regardless of whether it occurs in a tensed clause, the Penn Treebank 
tagset distinguishes VB (infinitive or imperative) from VBP (non-third person singular 
present tense). 
2.1.4 Indeterminacy. A final difference between the Penn Treebank tagset and all other 
tagsets we are aware of concerns the issue of indeterminacy: both POS ambiguity in 
the text and annotator uncertainty. In many cases, POS ambiguity can be resolved with 
reference to the linguistic context. So, for instance, in Katharine Hepburn's witty line 
Grant can be outspoken--but not by anyone I know, the presence of the by-phrase forces 
us to consider outspoken as the past participle of a transitive derivative of speak-- 
outspeak rather than as the adjective outspoken. However, even given explicit criteria 
for assigning POS tags to potentially ambiguous words, it is not always possible to 
assign a unique tag to a word with confidence. Since a major concern of the Treebank 
is to avoid requiring annotators to make arbitrary decisions, we allow words to be 
associated with more than one POS tag. Such multiple tagging indicates either that 
the word's part of speech simply cannot be decided or that the annotator is unsure 
which of the alternative tags is the correct one. In principle, annotators can tag a word 
with any number of tags, but in practice, multiple tags are restricted to a small number 
of recurring two-tag combinations: JJINN (adjective or noun as prenominal modifier), 
JJIVBG (adjective or gerund/present participle), JJ\[VBN (adjective or past participle), 
NNIVBG (noun or gerund), and RBIRP (adverb or particle). 
2.2 The POS Tagset 
The Penn Treebank tagset is given in Table 2. It contains 36 POS tags and 12 other 
tags (for punctuation and currency symbols). A detailed description of the guidelines 
governing the use of the tagset is available in Santorini (1990). 7 
2.3 The POS Tagging Process 
The tagged version of the Penn Treebank corpus is produced in two stages, using a 
combination of automatic POS assignment and manual correction. 
7 In versions of the tagged corpus distributed before November 1992, singular proper nouns, plural 
proper nouns, and personal pronouns were tagged as "NP," "NPS," and "PP," respectively. The current 
tags "NNP," "NNPS," and "PRP" were introduced in order to avoid confusion with the syntactic tags 
"NP" (noun phrase) and "PP" (prepositional phrase) (see Table 3).

2.3.1 Automated Stage. During the early stages of the Penn Treebank project, the 
initial automatic POS assignment was provided by PARTS (Church 1988), a stochastic 
algorithm developed at AT&T Bell Labs. PARTS uses a modified version of the Brown 
Corpus tagset close to our own and assigns POS tags with an error rate of 3-5%. The 
output of PARTS was automatically tokenized 8 and the tags assigned by PARTS were 
automatically mapped onto the Penn Treebank tagset. This mapping introduces about 
4% error, since the Penn Treebank tagset makes certain distinctions that the PARTS 
tagset does not. 9 A sample of the resulting tagged text, which has an error rate of 
7-9%, is shown in Figure 1. 
More recently, the automatic POS assignment is provided by a cascade of stochastic 
and rule-driven taggers developed on the basis of our early experience. Since these 
taggers are based on the Penn Treebank tagset, the 4% error rate introduced as an 
artefact of mapping from the PARTS tagset to ours is eliminated, and we obtain error 
rates of 2-6%. 
2.3.2 Manual Correction Stage. The result of the first, automated stage of POS tagging 
is given to annotators to correct. The annotators use a mouse-based package written 
8 In contrast to the Brown Corpus, we do not allow compound tags of the sort illustrated above for I'm. 
Rather, contractions and the Anglo-Saxon genitive of nouns are automatically split into their 
component morphemes, and each morpheme is tagged separately. Thus, children's is tagged 
"children/NNS 's/POS," and won't is tagged "wo-/MD n't/RB." 9 The two largest sources of mapping error are that the PARTS tagset distinguishes neither infinitives 
from non-third person singular present tense forms of verbs, nor prepositions from particles in cases 
like run up a hill and run up a bill.

in GNU Emacs Lisp, which is embedded within the GNU Emacs editor (Lewis et al. 
1990). The package allows annotators to correct POS assignment errors by positioning 
the cursor on an incorrectly tagged word and then entering the desired correct tag 
(or sequence of multiple tags). The annotators' input is automatically checked against 
the list of legal tags in Table 2 and, if valid, appended to the original word-tag pair 
separated by an asterisk. Appending the new tag rather than replacing the old tag 
allows us to easily identify recurring errors at the automatic POS assignment stage. 
We believe that the confusion matrices that can be extracted from this information 
should also prove useful in designing better automatic taggers in the future. The result 
of this second stage of POS tagging is shown in Figure 2. Finally, in the distribution 
version of the tagged corpus, any incorrect tags assigned at the first, automatic stage 
are removed. 
The learning curve for the POS tagging task takes under a month (at 15 hours a 
week), and annotation speeds after a month exceed 3,000 words per hour. 
3. Two Modes of AnnotationwAn Experiment 
To determine how to maximize the speed, inter-annotator consistency, and accuracy of 
POS tagging, we performed an experiment at the very beginning of the project to com- 
pare two alternative modes of annotation. In the first annotation mode ("tagging"), 
annotators tagged unannotated text entirely by hand; in the second mode ("correct- 
ing"), they verified and corrected the output of PARTS, modified as described above. 
318 
Mitchell P. Marcus et al. Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English 
This experiment showed that manual tagging took about twice as long as correcting, 
with about twice the inter-annotator disagreement rate and an error rate that was 
about 50% higher. 
Four annotators, all with graduate training in linguistics, participated in the exper- 
iment. All completed a training sequence consisting of 15 hours of correcting followed 
by 6 hours of tagging. The training material was selected from a variety of nonfiction 
genres in the Brown Corpus. All the annotators were familiar with GNU Emacs at the 
outset of the experiment. Eight 2,000-word samples were selected from the Brown Cor- 
pus, two each from four different genres (two fiction, two nonfiction), none of which 
any of the annotators had encountered in training. The texts for the correction task 
were automatically tagged as described in Section 2.3. Each annotator first manually 
tagged four texts and then corrected four automatically tagged texts. Each annotator 
completed the four genres in a different permutation. 
A repeated measures analysis of annotation speed with annotator identity, genre, 
and annotation mode (tagging vs. correcting) as classification variables showed a sig- 
nificant annotation mode effect (p = .05). No other effects or interactions were signif- 
icant. The average speed for correcting was more than twice as fast as the average 
speed for tagging: 20 minutes vs. 44 minutes per 1,000 words. (Median speeds per 
1,000 words were 22 vs. 42 minutes.) 
A simple measure of tagging consistency is inter-annotator disagreement rate, the 
rate at which annotators disagree with one another over the tagging of lexical tokens, 
expressed as a percentage of the raw number of such disagreements over the number 
of words in a given text sample. For a given text and n annotators, there are 
disagreement ratios (one for each possible pair of annotators). Mean inter-annotator 
disagreement was 7.2% for the tagging task and 4.1% for the correcting task (with me- 
dians 7.2% and 3.6%, respectively). Upon examination, a disproportionate amount of 
disagreement in the correcting case was found to be caused by one text that contained 
many instances of a cover symbol for chemical and other formulas. In the absence of 
an explicit guideline for tagging this case, the annotators had made different decisions 
on what part of speech this cover symbol represented. When this text is excluded 
from consideration, mean inter-annotator disagreement for the correcting task drops 
to 3.5%, with the median unchanged at 3.6%. 
Consistency, while desirable, tells us nothing about the validity of the annotators' 
corrections. We therefore compared each annotator's output not only with the output 
of each of the others, but also with a benchmark version of the eight texts. This 
benchmark version was derived from the tagged Brown Corpus by (1) mapping the 
original Brown Corpus tags onto the Penn Treebank tagset and (2) carefully hand- 
correcting the revised version in accordance with the tagging conventions in force at 
the time of the experiment. Accuracy was then computed as the rate of disagreement 
between each annotator's results and the benchmark version. The mean accuracy was 
5.4% for the tagging task (median 5.7%) and 4.0% for the correcting task (median 3.4%). 
Excluding the same text as above gives a revised mean accuracy for the correcting task 
of 3.4%, with the median unchanged. 
We obtained a further measure of the annotators' accuracy by comparing their 
error rates to the rates at which the raw output of Church's PARTS program--appropri- 
ately modified to conform to the Penn Treebank tagset--disagreed with the benchmark 
version. The mean disagreement rate between PARTS and the benchmark version was 
319 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
9.6%, while the corrected version had a mean disagreement rate of 5.4%, as noted 
above. 1Â° The annotators were thus reducing the error rate by about 4.2%. 
4. Bracketing 
4.1 Basic Methodology 
The methodology for bracketing the corpus is completely parallel to that for tagging-- 
hand correction of the output of an errorful automatic process. Fidditch, a deterministic 
parser developed by Donald Hindle first at the University of Pennsylvania and sub- 
sequently at AT&T Bell Labs (Hindle 1983, 1989), is used to provide an initial parse of 
the material. Annotators then hand correct the parser's output using a mouse-based 
interface implemented in GNU Emacs Lisp. Fidditch has three properties that make it 
ideally suited to serve as a preprocessor to hand correction: 
â€¢ Fidditch always provides exactly one analysis for any given sentence, so 
that annotators need not search through multiple analyses. 
â€¢ Fidditch never attaches any constituent whose role in the larger structure 
it cannot determine with certainty. In cases of uncertainty, Fidditch 
chunks the input into a string of trees, providing only a partial structure 
for each sentence. 
â€¢ Fidditch has rather good grammatical coverage, so that the grammatical 
chunks that it does build are usually quite accurate. 
Because of these properties, annotators do not need to rebracket much of the 
parser's output--a relatively time-consuming task. Rather, the annotators' main task 
is to "glue" together the syntactic chunks produced by the parser. Using a mouse-based 
interface, annotators move each unattached chunk of structure under the node to which 
it should be attached. Notational devices allow annotators to indicate uncertainty 
concerning constituent labels, and to indicate multiple attachment sites for ambiguous 
modifiers. The bracketing process is described in more detail in Section 4.3. 
4.2 The Syntactic Tagset 
Table 3 shows the set of syntactic tags and null elements that we use in our skeletal 
bracketing. More detailed information on the syntactic tagset and guidelines concern- 
ing its use are to be found in Santorini and Marcinkiewicz (1991). 
Although different in detail, our tagset is similar in delicacy to that used by the 
Lancaster Treebank Project, except that we allow null elements in the syntactic anno- 
tation. Because of the need to achieve a fairly high output per hour, it was decided 
not to require annotators to create distinctions beyond those provided by the parser. 
Our approach to developing the syntactic tagset was highly pragmatic and strongly 
influenced by the need to create a large body of annotated material given limited hu- 
man resources. Despite the skeletal nature of the bracketing, however, it is possible to 
make quite delicate distinctions when using the corpus by searching for combinations 
of structures. For example, an SBAR containing the word to immediately before the 
VP will necessarily be infinitival, while an SBAR containing a verb or auxiliary with a 
10 We would like to emphasize that the percentage given for the modified output of PARTS does not 
represent an error rate for PARTS. It reflects not only true mistakes in PARTS performance, but also the 
many and important differences in the usage of Penn Treebank POS tags and the usage of tags in the 
original Brown Corpus material on which PARTS was trained.

can be identified easily by searching for SBARs containing the word that or the null 
element 0 in initial position. 
As can be seen from Table 3, the syntactic tagset used by the Penn Treebank in- 
cludes a variety of null elements, a subset of the null elements introduced by Fidditch. 
While it would be expensive to insert null elements entirely by hand, it has not proved 
overly onerous to maintain and correct those that are automatically provided. We have 
chosen to retain these null elements because we believe that they can be exploited in 
many cases to establish a sentence's predicate-argument structure; at least one recipient 
of the parsed corpus has used it to bootstrap the development of lexicons for partic- 
ular NLP projects and has found the presence of null elements to be a considerable 
aid in determining verb transitivity (Robert Ingria, personal communication). While 
these null elements correspond more directly to entities in some grammatical theories 
than in others, it is not our intention to lean toward one or another theoretical view in 
producing our corpus. Rather, since the representational framework for grammatical 
structure in the Treebank is a relatively impoverished flat context-free notation, the eas- 
iest mechanism to include information about predicate-argument structure, although 
indirectly, is by allowing the parse tree to contain explicit null items. 
4.3 Sample Bracketing Output 
Below, we illustrate the bracketing process for the first sentence of our sample text. 
Figure 3 shows the output of Fidditch (modified slightly to include our POS tags). 
As Figure 3 shows, Fidditch leaves very many constituents unattached, labeling 
them as "?", and its output is perhaps better thought of as a string of tree fragments 
than as a single tree structure. Fidditch only builds structure when this is possible for 
a purely syntactic parser without access to semantic or pragmatic information, and it

always errs on the side of caution. Since determining the correct attachment point of 
prepositional phrases, relative clauses, and adverbial modifiers almost always requires 
extrasyntactic information, Fidditch pursues the very conservative strategy of always 
leaving such constituents unattached, even if only one attachment point is syntacti- 
cally possible. However, Fidditch does indicate its best guess concerning a fragment's 
attachment site by the fragment's depth of embedding. Moreover, it attaches preposi- 
tional phrases beginning with of if the preposition immediately follows a noun; thus, 
tale of... and boatload of... are parsed as single constituents, while first of... is not. 
Since Fidditch lacks a large verb lexicon, it cannot decide whether some constituents 
serve as adjuncts or arguments and hence leaves subordinate clauses such as infini- 
322 
Mitchell P. Marcus et al. Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English 
tives as separate fragments. Note further that Fidditch creates adjective phrases only 
when it determines that more than one lexical item belongs in the ADJP. Finally, as 
is well known, the scope of conjunctions and other coordinate structures can only 
be determined given the richest forms of contextual information; here again, Fidditch 
simply turns out a string of tree fragments around any conjunction. Because all de- 
cisions within Fidditch are made locally, all commas (which often signal conjunction) 
must disrupt the input into separate chunks. 
The original design of the Treebank called for a level of syntactic analysis compa- 
rable to the skeletal analysis used by the Lancaster Treebank, but a limited experiment 
was performed early in the project to investigate the feasibility of providing greater 
levels of structural detail. While the results were somewhat unclear, there was ev- 
idence that annotators could maintain a much faster rate of hand correction if the 
parser output was simplified in various ways, reducing the visual complexity of the 
tree representations and eliminating a range of minor decisions. The key results of this 
experiment were as follows: 
â€¢ Annotators take substantially longer to learn the bracketing task than the 
POS tagging task, with substantial increases in speed occurring even 
after two months of training. 
â€¢ Annotators can correct the full structure provided by Fidditch at an 
average speed of approximately 375 words per hour after three weeks 
and 475 words per hour after six weeks. 
â€¢ Reducing the output from the full structure shown in Figure 3 to a more 
skeletal representation similar to that used by the Lancaster UCREL 
Treebank Project increases annotator productivity by approximately 
100-200 words per hour. 
â€¢ It proved to be very difficult for annotators to distinguish between a 
verb's arguments and adjuncts in all cases. Allowing annotators to 
ignore this distinction when it is unclear (attaching constituents high) 
increases productivity by approximately 150-200 words per hour. 
Informal examination of later annotation showed that forced distinctions 
cannot be made consistently. 
As a result of this experiment, the originally proposed skeletal representation was 
adopted, without a forced distinction between arguments and adjuncts. Even after 
extended training, performance varies markedly by annotator, with speeds on the task 
of correcting skeletal structure without requiring a distinction between arguments and 
adjuncts ranging from approximately 750 words per hour to well over 1,000 words 
per hour after three or four months' experience. The fastest annotators work in bursts 
of well over 1,500 words per hour alternating with brief rests. At an average rate 
of 750 words per hour, a team of five part-time annotators annotating three hours a 
day should maintain an output of about 2.5 million words a year of "treebanked" 
sentences, with each sentence corrected once. 
It is worth noting that experienced annotators can proofread previously corrected 
material at very high speeds. A parsed subcorpus of over I million words was recently 
proofread at an average speed of approximately 4,000 words per annotator per hour. 
At this rate of productivity, annotators are able to find and correct gross errors in 
parsing, but do not have time to check, for example, whether they agree with all 
prepositional phrase attachments.

Sample bracketed text--after simplification, before correction. 
The process that creates the skeletal representations to be corrected by the anno- 
tators simplifies and flattens the structures shown in Figure 3 by removing POS tags, 
nonbranching lexical nodes, and certain phrasal nodes, notably NBAR. The output of 
the first automated stage of the bracketing task is shown in Figure 4. 
Annotators correct this simplified structure using a mouse-based interface. Their 
primary job is to "glue" fragments together, but they must also correct incorrect parses 
and delete some structure. Single mouse clicks perform the following tasks, among 
others. The interface correctly reindents the structure whenever necessary. 
â€¢ Attach constituents labeled ?. This is done by pressing down the 
appropriate mouse button on or immediately after the ?, moving the 
mouse onto or immediately after the label of the intended parent and 
releasing the mouse. Attaching constituents automatically deletes their ? 
label. 
â€¢ Promote a constituent up one level of structure, making it a sibling of its 
current parent. 
â€¢ Delete a pair of constituent brackets.

â€¢ Create a pair of brackets around a constituent. This is done by typing a 
constituent tag and then sweeping out the intended constituent with the 
mouse. The tag is checked to assure that it is a legal label. 
â€¢ Change the label of a constituent. The new tag is checked to assure that 
it is legal. 
The bracketed text after correction is shown in Figure 5. The fragments are now 
connected together into one rooted tree structure. The result is a skeletal analysis in 
that much syntactic detail is left unannotated. Most prominently, all internal structure 
of the NP up through the head and including any single-word post-head modifiers is 
left unannotated. 
As noted above in connection with POS tagging, a major goal of the Treebank 
project is to allow annotators only to indicate structure of which they were certain. The 
Treebank provides two notational devices to ensure this goal: the X constituent label 
and so-called "pseudo-attachment." The X constituent label is used if an annotator 
is sure that a sequence of words is a major constituent but is unsure of its syntactic 
category; in such cases, the annotator simply brackets the sequence and labels it X. The 
second notational device, pseudo-attachment, has two primary uses. On the one hand, 
325 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
it is used to annotate what Kay has called permanent predictable ambiguities, allowing an 
annotator to indicate that a structure is globally ambiguous even given the surrounding 
context (annotators always assign structure to a sentence on the basis of its context). An 
example of this use of pseudo-attachment is shown in Figure 5, where the participial 
phrase blown ashore 375 years ago modifies either warriors or boatload, but there is no way 
of settling the question--both attachments mean exactly the same thing. In the case 
at hand, the pseudo-attachment notation indicates that the annotator of the sentence 
thought that VP-1 is most likely a modifier of warriors, but that it is also possible that 
it is a modifier of boatload. 11 A second use of pseudo-attachment is to allow annotators 
to represent the "underlying" position of extraposed elements; in addition to being 
attached in its superficial position in the tree, the extraposed constituent is pseudo- 
attached within the constituent to which it is semantically related. Note that except 
for the device of pseudo-attachment, the skeletal analysis of the Treebank is entirely 
restricted to simple context-free trees. 
The reader may have noticed that the ADJP brackets in Figure 4 have vanished in 
Figure 5. For the sake of the overall efficiency of the annotation task, we leave all ADJP 
brackets in the simplified structure, with the annotators expected to remove many 
of them during annotation. The reason for this is somewhat complex, but provides 
a good example of the considerations that come into play in designing the details 
of annotation methods. The first relevant fact is that Fidditch only outputs ADJP 
brackets within NPs for adjective phrases containing more than one lexical item. To 
be consistent, the final structure must contain ADJP nodes for all adjective phrases 
within NPs or for none; we have chosen to delete all such nodes within NPs under 
normal circumstances. (This does not affect the use of the ADJP tag for predicative 
adjective phrases outside of NPs.) In a seemingly unrelated guideline, all coordinate 
structures are annotated in the Treebank; such coordinate structures are represented 
by Chomsky-adjunction when the two conjoined constituents bear the same label. 
This means that if an NP contains coordinated adjective phrases, then an ADJP tag 
will be used to tag that coordination, even though simple ADJPs within NPs will not 
bear an APJP tag. Experience has shown that annotators can delete pairs of brackets 
extremely quickly using the mouse-based tools, whereas creating brackets is a much 
slower operation. Because the coordination of adjectives is quite common, it is more 
efficient to leave in ADJP labels, and delete them if they are not part of a coordinate 
structure, than to reintroduce them if necessary.

5.1 Composition and Size of Corpus 
Table 4 shows the output of the Penn Treebank project at the end of its first phase. All 
the materials listed in Table 4 are available on CD-ROM to members of the Linguistic 
Data Consortium. 12 About 3 million words of POS-tagged material and a small sam- 
piing of skeletally parsed text are available as part of the first Association for Com- 
putational Linguistics/Data Collection Initiative CD-ROM, and a somewhat larger 
subset of materials is available on cartridge tape directly from the Penn Treebank 
Project. For information, contact the first author of this paper or send e-mail to tree- 
bank@unagi.cis.upenn.edu. 
11 This use of pseudo-attachment is identical to its original use in Church's parser (Church 1980).

Some comments on the materials included: 
â€¢ Department of Energy abstracts are scientific abstracts from a variety of 
disciplines. 
â€¢ All of the skeletally parsed Dow Jones Newswire materials are also 
available as digitally recorded read speech as part of the DARPA 
WSJ-CSR1 corpus, available through the Linguistic Data Consortium. 
â€¢ The Department of Agriculture materials include short bulletins on such 
topics as when to plant various flowers and how to can various 
vegetables and fruits. 
â€¢ The Library of America texts are 5,000-10,000 word passages, mainly 
book chapters, from a variety of American authors including Mark 
Twain, Henry Adams, Willa Cather, Herman Melville, W. E. B. Dubois, 
and Ralph Waldo Emerson. 
â€¢ The MUC-3 texts are all news stories from the Federal News Service 
about terrorist activities in South America. Some of these texts are 
translations of Spanish news stories or transcripts of radio broadcasts. 
They are taken from training materials for the Third Message 
Understanding Conference. 
â€¢ The Brown Corpus materials were completely retagged by the Penn 
Treebank project starting from the untagged version of the Brown 
Corpus (Francis 1964). 
â€¢ The IBM sentences are taken from IBM computer manuals; they are 
chosen to contain a vocabulary of 3,000 words, and are limited in length. 
â€¢ The ATIS sentences are transcribed versions of spontaneous sentences 
collected as training materials for the DARPA Air Travel Information 
System project. 
The entire corpus has been tagged for POS information, at an estimated error rate 
327 
Computational Linguistics Volume 19, Number 2 
of approximately 3%. The POS-tagged version of the Library of America texts and the 
Department of Agriculture bulletins have been corrected twice (each by a different 
annotator), "and the corrected files were then carefully adjudicated; we estimate the 
error rate of the adjudicated version at well under 1%. Using a version of PARTS 
retrained on the entire preliminary corpus and adjudicating between the output of the 
retrained version and the preliminary version of the corpus, we plan to reduce the 
error rate of the final version of the corpus to approximately 1%. All the skeletally 
parsed materials have been corrected once, except for the Brown materials, which have 
been quickly proofread an additional time for gross parsing errors. 
5.2 Future Directions 
A large number of research efforts, both at the University of Pennsylvania and else- 
where, have relied on the output of the Penn Treebank Project to date. A few examples 
already in print: a number of projects investigating stochastic parsing have used either 
the POS-tagged materials (Magerman and Marcus 1990; Brill et al. 1990; Brill 1991) or 
the skeletally parsed corpus (Weischedel et al. 1991; Pereira and Schabes 1992). The 
POS-tagged corpus has also been used to train a number of different POS taggers in- 
cluding Meteer, Schwartz, and Weischedel (1991), and the skeletally parsed corpus has 
been used in connection with the development of new methods to exploit intonational 
cues in disambiguating the parsing of spoken sentences (Veilleux and Ostendorf 1992). 
The Penn Treebank has been used to bootstrap the development of lexicons for particu- 
lar applications (Robert Ingria, personal communication) and is being used as a source 
of examples for linguistic theory and psychological modelling (e.g. Niv 1991). To aid 
in the search for specific examples of grammatical phenomena using the Treebank, 
Richard Pito has developed tgrep, a tool for very fast context-free pattern matching 
against the skeletally parsed corpus, which is available through the Linguistic Data 
Consortium. 
While the Treebank is being widely used, the annotation scheme employed has a 
variety of limitations. Many otherwise clear argument/adjunct relations in the corpus 
are not indicated because of the current Treebank's essentially context-free represen- 
tation. For example, there is at present no satisfactory representation for sentences in 
which complement noun phrases or clauses occur after a sentential level adverb. Either 
the adverb is trapped within the VP, so that the complement can occur within the VP 
where it belongs, or else the adverb is attached to the S, closing off the VP and forcing 
the complement to attach to the S. This "trapping" problem serves as a limitation for 
groups that currently use Treebank material semiautomatically to derive lexicons for 
particular applications. For most of these problems, however, solutions are possible 
on the basis of mechanisms already used by the Treebank Project. For example, the 
pseudo-attachment notation can be extended to indicate a variety of crossing depen- 
dencies. We have recently begun to use this mechanism to represent various kinds 
of dislocations, and the Treebank annotators themselves have developed a detailed 
proposal to extend pseudo-attachment to a wide range of similar phenomena. 
A variety of inconsistencies in the annotation scheme used within the Treebank 
have also become apparent with time. The annotation schemes for some syntactic 
categories should be unified to allow a consistent approach to determining predicate- 
argument structure. To take a very simple example, sentential adverbs attach under 
VP when they occur between auxiliaries and predicative ADJPs, but attach under S 
when they occur between auxiliaries and VPs. These structures need to be regularized. 
As the current Treebank has been exploited by a variety of users, a significant 
number have expressed a need for forms of annotation richer than provided by the 
project's first phase. Some users would like a less skeletal form of annotation of surface 
328 
Mitchell P. Marcus et al. Building a Large Annotated Corpus of English 
grammatical structure, expanding the essentially context-free analysis of the current 
Penn Treebank to indicate a wide variety of noncontiguous structures and dependen- 
cies. A wide range of Treebank users now strongly desire a level of annotation that 
makes explicit some form of predicate-argument structure. The desired level of rep- 
resentation would make explicit the logical subject and logical object of the verb, and 
would indicate, at least in clear cases, which subconstituents serve as arguments of 
the underlying predicates and which serve as modifiers. 
During the next phase of the Treebank project, we expect to provide both a richer 
analysis of the existing corpus and a parallel corpus of predicate-argument structures. 
This will be done by first enriching the annotation of the current corpus, and then 
automatically extracting predicate-argument structure, at the level of distinguishing 
logical subjects and objects, and distinguishing arguments from adjuncts for clear 
cases. Enrichment will be achieved by automatically transforming the current Penn 
Treebank into a level of structure close to the intended target, and then completing 
the conversion by hand.
